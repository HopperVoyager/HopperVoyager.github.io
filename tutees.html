          Need to request a tutor? Here's how it works!
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li class="tutees_li">All students may pick up a “Request for Peer Tutor” form during lunch in my room, F-5 or print out the form on this website.</li>
          <li class="tutees_li"></br>Once the application is turned in, we put it into our database, then into a red binder by subject area. Tutors stop by during lunch to check the red binders to see if they can pick up a student for tutoring. If they find a match to their subject area and time they call the student.</li>
          <li class="tutees_li"></br>If you receive a call from a tutor, you are invited back to room F-5 during lunch to meet your tutor and fill out three “Tutor Contract” forms.</li>
          <li class="tutees_li last_li"></br>The tutor keeps a form, gives one to the student, and I retain the third copy, for my records. Students meet and tutor together from that point on.<li>
        </ol>
          <p></br></br>You are encouraged to check back within a week if you have not received a call from a tutor.</p>
