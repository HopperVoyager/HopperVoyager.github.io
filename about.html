        <h2>What is the Innis Residence Council?</h2>
        <p>
          The Innis Residence Council (IRC) is a student-run governing council for the students who live at Innis Residence throughout the academic year. The IRC is composed of 5 executive members who are elected by the residents, 6 Senior House Representatives, 6 Domestic Junior House Representatives, 6 International Junior House Representatives and numerous committee chairs. All residents are welcome to attend the bi-weekly IRC meetings.
          <br/>
          The mission of the IRC is to provide support and encourage unity among residents by organizing residence-wide events, such as: monthly House Olympics; social outings; and trips around Innis and Toronto. The IRC gives students the chance to get involved in the Innis community and provides opportunities to develop leadership skills by providing moral and monetary support for clubs, suite events, and committees.
